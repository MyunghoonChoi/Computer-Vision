# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for various computer vision projects I implemented during my studies.

## Projects

### Project 1: Image Filtering and Corner Detection

#### Overview
In this project, I implemented various image filtering techniques and corner detection algorithms to analyze and process images.

#### Files
- `Image Filtering and Corner Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation, experiments, and results for the project.

#### Summary
This project includes the implementation of different filtering techniques such as Gaussian blur, edge detection using Sobel filters, and corner detection using the Harris Corner Detection algorithm. The results show the effectiveness of these methods in identifying important features in images.

### Project 2: Object Tracking and Motion Analysis

#### Overview
This project focuses on object tracking and motion analysis using various computer vision techniques.

#### Files
- `Object Tracking and Motion Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation, experiments, and results for the project.

#### Summary
The project involves implementing object tracking algorithms like the Kalman filter and optical flow methods. Motion analysis is performed to track and predict the movement of objects in video sequences.

### Project 3: SIFT Features and Face Detection

#### Overview
In this project, I implemented the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm for feature detection and used it for face detection.

#### Files
- `SIFT Features and Face Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation, experiments, and results for the project.

#### Summary
The project demonstrates the use of SIFT for extracting distinctive features from images and applying these features for robust face detection. The results highlight the ability of SIFT to handle scale and rotation variations in images.
